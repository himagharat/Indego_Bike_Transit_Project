### *Background*
In 2015, Philadelphia launched an option of public transportation via bicycle riding. In partnership with Bicycle Transit Systems, the City of Philadelphia created the program [Indego]( https://www.rideindego.com/). Indego is a bike sharing system, that allows riders to access bicycles for a fee from over 140 stations throughout the Philadelphia Metropolitan area. Since the launch of the program, more than 4 million rides have been taken. 

Based on this high frequency count, and relative new conception to Philadelphia, it seemed relevant to analyze this system of transportation to better understand the variability of its use under different factors. By analyzing usage frequency across multiple years, an understanding into the popularity across time could be deciphered.
